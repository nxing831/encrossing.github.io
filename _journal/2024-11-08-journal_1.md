november has been a big month for privacy concerns! despite the excitement of finally getting this website rolling, i find myself hesitant to post the way i would on my private social media. particular sources of concern include:

*  my class on digital law starting a unit on privacy, hence a growing sense of dread realizing that my entire identity could be scraped straight off the internet
*  for class-independent reasons, a growing sense of dread realizing that my entire identity could be scraped straight off the internet
*  the strangeness of then continuing to post personal journal entries on what could easily be an interactive CV website instead
*  the above likely stemming from a recent rejection of instagram leaving some sort of a digital hole in my rotting brain
*  trying to understand why a public website is scarier than a private instagram page (e.g., there might be more random visitors, but anyone who really tries can likely scrape my private account anyways)

question of the day: why am i compelled to use a github pages site as a digital journal? i was so excited to post climbing videos, pictures of where i'd been, blogs on what i'd been thinking, and more. from that alone, i realize, one could reconstruct so much of my life: the possibilities of malicious intent are incredibly off-putting. but i think, too, that i made this website with those very hopes (sans malice) in mind. some part of me believes that, simply by being on a separate website, visitors can see me as something more than the occasional instagram photodump (highly curated sequence of photos). i like to believe there is something quasi-sympathetic evoked in a webiste, something a social media platform would fail to capture. i wonder when the two become distinct in my book?
