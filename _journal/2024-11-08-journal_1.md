november has been a big month for privacy concerns! despite the excitement of finally getting this website rolling, i find myself hesitant to post the way i would on my private social media. particular sources of concern include:

*  my class on digital law starting a unit on privacy, hence a growing sense of dread realizing that my entire identity could be scraped straight off the internet
*  for class-independent reasons, a growing sense of dread realizing that my entire identity could be scraped straight off the internet
*  the strangeness of then continuing to post personal journal entries on what could easily be an interactive CV website instead
*  the above likely stemming from a recent rejection of instagram leaving some sort of a digital hole in my rotting brain
*  trying to understand why a public website is scarier than a private instagram page (e.g., there might be more random visitors, but anyone who really tries can likely scrape my private account anyways)

why am i compelled to use a github pages site as a digital journal? i was so excited to post climbing videos, pictures of where i'd been, blogs on what i'd been thinking, and more. from that alone, i realize, one could reconstruct so much of my life: the possibilities of malicious intent are incredibly off-putting. and yet, in some weird way, this website was also made to be explored. i hope for visitors to form their opinions based on something more holistic than the occasional instagram photodump (highly curated sequence of photos). there is something more sympathetic evoked in the exploration of someone's website, i think, than their social media persona. when did the two become distinct?
