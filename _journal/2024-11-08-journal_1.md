november has been a big month for privacy concerns! despite the excitement of finally getting this website rolling, i find myself hesitant to post the way i would on my private social media. particular sources of concern include:

*  my class on digital law starting a unit on privacy, hence a growing sense of dread realizing that my entire identity could be scraped straight off the internet
*  for class-independent reasons, a growing sense of dread realizing that my entire identity could be scraped straight off the internet
*  the strangeness of then continuing to post personal journal entries on what could easily be an interactive CV website instead
*  the above likely stemming from a recent rejection of instagram leaving some sort of a digital hole in my rotting brain
*  trying to understand why a public website is scarier than a private instagram page (e.g., there might be more random visitors, but anyone who really tries can likely scrape my private account anyways)

question of the day: why am i compelled to use a github pages site as a digital journal? i was so excited to post about more than school projects. but from that extra bit, i realize, one could reconstruct so much of my life: the possibilities of malicious intent are incredibly off-putting. i like to believe there is something quasi-sympathetic evoked in a webiste, something a social media platform would fail to capture. but who knows if that's just wishful thinking?
