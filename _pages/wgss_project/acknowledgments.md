I am grateful to my family. To YL, for introducing me to real thinking. To JM, for keeping me afloat with laughs. To JH, for knowing and seeing me. To CI, WY for always checking in. To XD, FG, MY, AC, TL, JY, MO, and more, for helping me hold on. To MS and SW for lighting the fire. To Prof. Pamela Harris for encouraging me. To Prof. Rishi Nath for believing in me. To Dimensions, a community I'm proud of. To the Yale Math Department, especially IA, MH, LW, YM, CW. To my WGSS 328 class, my interviewees, RH, RB, and all those who aided in this project. There are so few but so many people to hold.
