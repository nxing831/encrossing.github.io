A critical of reading of the humanities today involves, in part, a simultaneous taking and rejection of previous works, even those deemed seminal. There is an acknowledgment of the colonial and capitalist roots in Western scholarship, and it is possible to study the humanities in perhaps a more "conscious" manner today. 

I think, for example, of Sara Ahmed's [*Queer Phenomenology*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv125jk6w), in which she questions what it means to determine "orientation" and radically reimagines the way people inhabit space and identity. Ahmed calls upon queer and feminist scholars such as Judith Butler and Simone de Beauvoir; at the same time, she demonstratively recalls Kant's ["What Does It Mean to Orient Oneself in Thought?"](https://assets.cambridge.org/97811071/49595/excerpt/9781107149595_excerpt.pdf) and Heidegger's [*Being in Time*](http://pdf-objects.com/files/Heidegger-Martin-Being-and-Time-trans.-Macquarrie-Robinson-Blackwell-1962.pdf)–neither of which are exactly anti-Western canon. Ahmed, like many of her contemporary peers, proposes something which is not a perfect antidote to old ideology; in interweaving queer reinterpretation, however, she attempts to leave some damages behind.

Certainly in the humanities these paradigm shifts are not easy; to reject a popular idea is to metaphorically remove the foundations of those which came after. But in mathematics, the problem is twofold: firstly, to reject a mathematical idea is to reject truth itself. Secondly, hypothetically rejecting one theorem in mathematics would axiomatically destroy all of the mathematics to follow. It is not a departure from a philosophical ideal, as in the humanities. All the math ever proven is simply truth.

Then, too, there is no mathematical untruth which can become true through some discriminatory lens. The purity of mathematics both elevates and cripples: it is immune to attempts to deceive, and yet this very property enables–even encourages–its weaponization. 

One might look at arguments on slavery for two diametrically opposed examples: in Alfred H. Conrad and John R. Meyer's widely-cited study, ["The Economics of Slavery in the Antebellum South"](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/258020) (1958), they leverage cliometric methods to demonstrate that slavery was profitable for slaveowners, dispelling the once-common argument that slaveowners nobly kept "incompetent" slaves employed out of goodwill. On the other hand, the reduction of human beings to mere numbers on paper–debts, transactions, lives referenced as data points–is an oft-referenced practice of the Transatlantic Slave Trade that dehumanized millions. It's recognized that the invention of racism bypassed laws, religious standards, and other moralisms that might have stood in the way of slavery. Scholars today suggest that, beyond record-keeping, the logbooks and ledgers of the slave trade performed a similar function. Jennifer Morgan's ["Numeracy and Archival Fragments in Understanding the Black Atlantic"](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/127/3/1436/6850963) (2021) is such a work.

Many point out the distinction between mathematics itself and its misapplications. I can understand such an argument and the appeal. In fact, some even suggest "true" mathematicians is, in a sense, gender and race-blind, given that a mathematical contribution is irrefutable and provably independent of the contributor. Of the commonly-cited women who made historically notable contributions in mathematics, many were received well within their fields. Sophie Germain, for example, [delighted Lagrange so much](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Germain/) that he took to mentoring her. [Gauss](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-gazette/article/abs/sophie-germain-or-was-gauss-a-feminist/6176F6C98067333F574636CD4A40D22C), too, wrote to Germain, 
>"How can I describe my astonishment and admiration on seeing my esteemed correspondent M. Le Blanc metamorphosed into this celebrated person ... when a woman, because of her sex, our customs and prejudices, encounters infinitely more obstacles than men in familiarising herself with [number theory's] knotty problems, yet overcomes these fetters and penetrates that which is most hidden, she doubtless has the noblest courage, extraordinary talent, and superior genius."

In another case, Emmy Noether was forced the lecture under a male pseudonym due to the [criticism of the philosophy department](https://scientificwomen.net/women/noether-emmy-75) at the University of Göttingen, not mathematicians Hilbert and Klein, who had invited her there to teach. Even further back and one encounters incredible examples such as Hypatia of Alexandria (born approx. 350-370 AD). 

This, of course, is not to diminish the real discrimination countless female mathematicians have experienced in history, many times at the hands of fellow mathematicians. Simply treating two people with the same attitude will produce varied results if society values their worth as individuals differently. Blindness is not enough. The truth remains that mathematical ability has implications far beyond the walls of the university, and that there are statistically significant discrepancies in performance and interest between racial, socioeconomic, and gendered groups. 

For these reasons, I enrolled in WGSS 328 in hopes of understanding a study which has, at times, nurtured so many feelings of personal unbelonging and failure. It seems now that I may never not be confused; I see now, without resentment, that the harm is as mundane and random as it is systematic and organized. 

In the following pages I explore not the banality of evil, but mundane harms. I attempt to map those minds which have been amplified or silenced at different points of time. I defer to history for both its admirable and upsetting aspects, and engage the politics of rejection, truth, self-punishment, and community action. I aim to challenge the generalizability of humanistic reimaginings to the field of mathematics, and reckon with tradition, revolution, and consolidation along the way.

I am grateful for those who have aided my journey, many of whom are interviewed throughout the course of this project.
