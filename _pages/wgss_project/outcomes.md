Lastly, here are some of my efforts to improve the math community at Yale. In a sense, I view this project as a reckoning with my service, and so this section is what I am most proud of.

**Dimensions** is Yale's only group for women and gender minorities in mathematics. 

Since becoming Dimensions' co-president, the board and I have:
  * Increased the frequency of meetings from once a semester to multiple times weekly
  * Secured thousands of dollars in corporate sponsorships and created a resume book to connect members with companies
  * Created and maintained a new website and Instagram account
  * Tripled the number of subscribed students on our mailing list
  * Added Dimensions as an official Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) chapter
  * Registered Dimensions as a 501c(3) nonprofit
  * Created a Dimensions bank account and credit card for reimbursement and ease of treasury handover
  * Hosted office visits, job panels, research panels, and social events

**Climate Committee** is the Yale Math Department's effort to improve community and belonging; it is comprised of faculty, graduate students, and (traditionally) two undergraduates.

At Climate Committee, I've pioneered or assisted with:
  * Providing free menstrual products for the math department's floors in Kline Tower
  * Reviving department outreach to New Haven children
  * Putting up a DEIB board on the 8th floor of Kline Tower with resources, upcoming events, and a diversity statement
  * Organizing a yearly colloquium with an invited mathematician of social relevance
  * Serving as a liasion between undergraduate students and faculty, especially by connecting the interests of Dimensions with Climate Committee
  * Improving community between female faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students by organizing social events
