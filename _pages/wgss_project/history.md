At its founding, Yale's curriculum was largely focused on religious training; its mission, as stated in its [1701 charter](https://guides.library.yale.edu/yalehistory), declares an intention to prepare youth for "Publick employment both in Church and Civil State." Therefore, beyond theological instruction, some emphasis was also given to the classics, humanities, and natural sciences. In particular, with focus to astronomy, arithmetic and geometry were a part of the early curriculum.

By the turn of the 18th century, Europe had experienced a range of algebraic breakthroughs. Gauss proved the fundamental theorem of algebra, a crowning achievement that followed centuries of seminal results on solving cubic, quartic, and systems of linear equations. Thus, algebra soon followed as an addition to the Yale mathematics curriculum. In 1743, [fluxions](https://ia801607.us.archive.org/23/items/methodoffluxions00newt/methodoffluxions00newt.pdf), or a course on calculus, was being offered to juniors.

After the 1755 establishment of the first professorship at Yale on sacred theology, the second professorship created in 1770 was for mathematics, natural philosphy, and astronomy. Nehemiah Strong became Yale's first professor of mathematic. A 1755 graduate of Yale College, Yale was an acclaimed astronomer, largely due to his treatise *A new theory of the harmonious Regularity observable in the Mechanism or Movements of the Planetary System.* He resigned from Yale in a salary dispute, and Yale Corporation was happy to let him go, believing he was not sufficiently patriotic. He was succeeded by Jeremiah Meigs, followed by the Reverend Jeremiah Day, who held the chair of mathematics and natural philosophy from 1803-1820 and became Yale's President in 1817.

Between the years 1920-1930, Yale experienced a transition from classical mathematics to, relatively speaking, modern mathematics. Undergraduate teaching reforms from 1918-1919, too, affected the way mathematics was taught at
