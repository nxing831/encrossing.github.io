welcome to my website! it's new, constantly under construction, and empty \\(\mu-a.e\\)., but i'll be storing projects, blog posts, and some random stuff on here.

**the academic:** i'm nicole, and i'm an undergraduate math major at yale. my research interests are ???, but i'm currently researching:
* graph-aware PEFT for LLMs with the Rex Ying Graph & Geometric Learning Lab (Yale)
* discrete mathematics with Prof. Pablo Sober√≥n (CUNY Baruch). 

my brief CV is [here](cv/ "cv").

**the fun:** playing bass / all things music, rock climbing, an emergent but unsuccessful foray into pottery, a dying love of painting, books that feel more like work than fun these days, long runs, fishing, taking naps. i might occasionally post about these in my [journal](journal/ "journal")!
