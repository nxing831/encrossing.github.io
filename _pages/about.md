welcome to my web archive! i'll be storing pretty much everything here (read: this site is not an interactive CV, nor is it navigable). **this website is under construction and empty almost everywhere :3**

**the academic:** i'm nicole, and i'm an undergraduate math major at yale! my research interests are ???, but i'm currently researching:
* graph-aware PEFT for LLMs with the Rex Ying Graph & Geometric Learning Lab (Yale)
* discrete mathematics with Prof. Pablo SÃ³beron (CUNY Baruch). 

if you really want it, you can access my CV [here](cv/ "cv").

**the fun:** playing bass / all things music, rock climbing, an emergent but unsuccessful foray into pottery, a dying love of painting, books that feel more like work than fun these days, long runs, fishing, taking naps. you can read about all manner of these things in my [journal](journal.html "journal")!
