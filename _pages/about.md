welcome to my digital archive! it's under construction \\(\mu-a.e\\). and an aspiring home for my projects, blog posts, and other human thoughts. 

**the academic:** i'm nicole, and i'm an undergraduate math major at yale. i'm currently researching:
* hyperbolic representation learning with the Rex Ying Graph & Geometric Learning Lab (Yale)
* discrete mathematics with Prof. Pablo Soberón (CUNY Baruch). 

roughly speaking, my academic interests include differential geometry, machine learning, and cryptography. i'm curious about web3 / ZK and ergodic theory!

my brief CV is [here](cv/ "cv").

**the fun:** playing bass & all things music, rock climbing, a dying love of painting, books that feel more like work than fun these days, long runs, fishing, taking naps!
