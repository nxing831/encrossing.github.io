# I. Background
In the Fall of 2024, I was enrolled in the first iteration of WGSS 328 ("I Don't Like to Argue": The Styles and Politics of Humility) at Yale. The [course description](https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99561/assignments/syllabus) offers some of the questions which guided the semester: "What can academic writing do besides argue? Why does critical thinking so often compel an idiom of claiming, exploring, discovering, and mastering? What might writers strive for, if not newness, rigor, excellence, or even one’s own voice? In this class, we defamiliarize and repair the habits of mind and body that have been normalized by the university." This was created as a final project for WGSS 328, meant to wrangle with tradition and change in the academic sciences.

I enrolled in WGSS 328 after two years of advocating for a more supportive and equitable environment for gender minorities in the Yale math department. At the time of writing, I am co-president of Dimensions, Yale's only student group for gender minorities in the mathematics, and have served on the department's [climate committee](https://math.yale.edu/yale-math-statement-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-belonging) for two years. A reflection on Dimensions and DEIB efforts with the climate committee occur in the project here (link later) and here (also link later), respectively. 

Of all that I witnessed, much felt too mundane to be worth discussing. It felt impossible, too, to suggest anything; what ideas–math or not–could I possibly offer to a room full of mathematicians significantly more qualified than I? I found it uncomfortable–offensive to others, almost–to express opinions without first undermining myself. Even now, with the understanding that scientists may read these words, I find myself performing the same habits and rituals.

These senses of self-imposed smallness and the mundanity of harm are threads I attempt to draw upon in this work. 

## Structure
This project is structured in three parts. Firstly, I aim to understand the [history of the Yale math department](\pages/wgss_project/history\). My thanks to Yale mathematics Professor Emeritus Richard Beals, who aided my research greatly by sharing his manuscript detailing precisely this. 

Secondly, I [author an experimental collection](\pages/wgss_project/essays\) of essays, shorter excerpts, and other multimedia regarding scientific academia, with particular regard to mathematics. This part is both personal, with interviews (link) and attempts to record the personal side (link) of math, as well as general (link), where I examine the implications of liberating efforts in mathematics beyond Yale and the self. 

Lastly, I detail tangible [outcomes](\pages/wgss_project/outcomes\) of my work, both before the start of WGSS 328 and thereafter. Examples include [menstural products in Kline tower](\link here\) and (another example).

## Disclaimer
As an aside, I feel the need to express the obvious disclaimer that there is strong contradiction and irony in deconstructing academic authority at Yale. I often think that such a class would be ridiculed, if not for occurring at an institution which excels at the various patterns my assigned readings suggest repairing or rejecting. Personally, I always experience a knee-jerk aversion to institutionalizing radicalism in any form (though I am open to hearing arguments for it). I elaborate on my time spent in class here (link).
